This is where to place any files to patch upstream projects. The patches are whole files and must be added with their full relative path. For example, if you're making applying a patch to onos/apps/vtn/vtnrsc/src/main/java/org/onosproject/vtnrsc, then you'll need that entire directory path here. Use copy and paste of the location after running "pwd". You can then use "mkdir -p" to create the full path.
